Collectively developed the below functions :
1) future_alloc - Allocates memory to the future variable using getmem system call.
2) future_get - Called by the consumer on a future. Makes the consumer wait until the future state becomes valid i.e producer has produced the value available for the consumer to consume.
3) future_set - Called by the producer to set the value produced to the global variable.Also makes the future state valid.
4) future_free - Frees the allocated memory and releases heap storage.

Created a header file "future.h" which includes the prototypes of the functions that the future uses. Also created two application files , future_prod and future_cons for producing and consuming the values.Added a -f parameter to prodcons shell command to demonstrate the application of futures.


Output :

Since j is assigned a random unsigned int address of the fut variable , j is some negative number.

xsh $ prodcons -f

It produced -2129942996

It produced -2129942980

It produced -2129942964

xsh $

Hence we can see that the consumer waits for the producer to produce a value and then display it.Thus synchronization is achieved.
