Implemented File System functions like :
1)Read - To Read from a file using bs_bread at a lower level.
2)Write - to write to a file using bs_bwrite at a lower level.
3)Seek - To set file pointer to a particular offset.
4)Close - Changing the file state in the open file table.
5)Open-  Opens the file if it has already been created.
Also implemented modes for file permissions, by adding an extra field in the filetable struct.

All the work was done in collaboration.
